## 📊 Analytical Insights
Despite the lower CAC and higher average order value of targeted advertising, retention for this audience was significantly lower (D7 = 9% vs. 22%). This resulted in a negative ROI for the channel.
For a delivery service, repeat orders are the key profit factor. Retention, not acquisition cost or the size of the first order, determines the long-term economics of the channel.
